# Testing Practice

This project demonstrates Test-Driven Development practices in JavaScript, using Jest as the testing framework.

## Project Overview

This repository contains five tested JavaScript modules:

1. **capitalize** - String manipulation with first character capitalization
2. **reverseString** - String reversal functionality
3. **calculator** - Basic arithmetic operations object
4. **caesarCipher** - Classic encryption algorithm implementation
5. **analyzeArray** - Statistical analysis of numerical arrays

## Learning Outcomes

Through completing this project, I have:

- Gained hands-on experience with the Jest framework
- Learned to think critically about edge cases and potential failure points
- Developed the ability to write self-documenting, testable code in JavaScript

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Jest**
- **Babel**: ES6 module transpilation for Jest compatibility
- **npm**
